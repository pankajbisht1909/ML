Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is one of the most basic machine learning models that a machine learning enthusiast gets to know about.
In linear regression, we assume that the two variables i.e. dependent and independent variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).
